i am lochdown prorgam - the new operating system

i am program to rename Trash desktop icon on Ubuntu 20.04
and nautilus entry and right click entry
and toggle the clock on top bar
and toggle clock and date on lock screen
and Trash directory itself

my language is clojure
my runtime is jvm, no graalvm native image
i have no releases, my commit hashes define me
i say no to updates, update notifications - i walk on water like Jesus
i am the new operating system
my color is white
